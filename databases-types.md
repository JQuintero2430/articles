To pick the right tool for the job, it's crucial to select the ideal database for each of our use cases. Understanding these six database types will help us make the best decision when the time comes.

### **1. Key-Value Databases**

The most representative example of a key-value database is **Redis**. By definition, they have a structure similar to JavaScript objects or Python maps. They use a set of unique keys associated with a specific value. These databases often have designs oriented towards in-memory storage, which makes them fast and useful for **caching**. However, their capacity is limited since they aren't disk-based, and they don't allow for filtered searches or complex associations.

### **2. Wide-Column Databases**

A great example of this type is **Cassandra DB**. Its structure is based on a key associated with a series of columns that store specific data without following a fixed structure. This allows each key to have different columns, adapting to the needs of the record and the business. You can also retrieve the specific values you need using query languages like CQL. They are easy to scale because they are decentralized, which allows data to be replicated across different nodes. However, they do not permit relationships in queries. These databases are ideal for storing large amounts of data generated by a single source over specific periods. They are geared towards use cases with frequent writes but sporadic updates and reads. For example, they can be used for search or price histories, or as an intermediate database in distributed design patterns to store data temporarily before persisting it in a more complete database.

### **3. Document Databases**

In this category, we find databases like **MongoDB**, **Firebase Firestore**, and **CouchDB**. In them, each "document" is a container of key-value pairs. These documents are grouped into collections, which allows for a more flexible and scalable organization of data. Additionally, fields can be indexed to optimize searching, and hierarchical structures can be created using sub-documents or arrays. The most appropriate way to store data is by grouping the data you need to display together in a single entry, as **joins** aren't possible. Write and update processes often require greater complexity, but reads are very fast. They are useful if you don't have a clear, defined structure, such as in an **MVP**, or if the structure has a clear entity but doesn't always have the same data types, as in some **IoT** apps. They are also very useful as a read database within design patterns like **CQRS**.

### **4. Relational Databases**

This is the most traditional and widely used type of database. Its structure is based on tables with columns and records stored in rows. These rows store information that can be related to one another through unique values (**primary keys**) using the **SQL** language. For this to be possible, the data must be stored in a normalized way using schemas. This allows the database to comply with **ACID** principles when performing an operation, which is its main advantage.

### **5. Graph Databases**

An example of this type of database is **Neo4j**. In this type of DB, relationships are data that are treated as edges, and the objects to be related are the nodes of the structure. This allows for many-to-many relationships without the need for intermediate tables. They are ideal for recommendation systems, trend mapping used in fraud detection, and for modeling complex connections.They are also used for a variety of cases that benefit from visualizing complex relationships, such as in social networks. For instance, they can be used for building functionalities like friend suggestions by identifying people you may know based on shared connections. Additionally, they can be applied to analyze influence within a network and to detect communities of users with similar interests.Furthermore, graph databases are useful for identity and access management by modeling the relationships between users, roles, permissions, and resources. This allows for quick permission verification and simplifies security audits. In logistics, they are used to optimize supply chains, analyze the impact of failures in a network, and plan the most efficient routes between different points.

### **6. Search-Oriented Databases**

These are generally based on the **Apache Lucene** project. One of the most representative databases of this type is **Elasticsearch**, which allows for full-text searches and real-time data analysis. Their function is similar to that of document databases, but in the background, the database analyzes the entire document, creating searchable indices that generate matches through small entries. They tend to be costly in terms of performance but significantly improve the user experience.

Knowing these databases will give you the tools to choose the one that best suits your needs.
